                Principles
                of Information
                Systems" course.
                Our team, which
                consists of Pasha Zulfugarli, Nihat Mammadli, Vasif Maharramli, and Javid Ibadov, works with the
                assignments givenÂ by
                our instructor. So far, we designed the website and organized the Hour Of Code event at one of
                Baku's
                secondary schools.
                We get to work right away and do it efficiently and enthusiastically. We put a lot of effort into
                doing our best as a
                team as well as individually.</p>
